# Credit-card-Fraud-detection-with-Random-Forest-Classification
An algorithm that can detect fradulent transactions after training with data extracted from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) 

For this project, I used the popular dataset 'creditcard.csv' from Kaggle. By splitting the data into training and test sets and evaluating the accuracy of the most common
machine learning models, the project comes to the conclusion that random forest privides the best predictions about a set of transactions being fraudulent or not.
